# Tajo
Tajo is a NodeJS encrypted, secure and temporary file host.

## About

Inspired by http://pomf.se

Coded by an amateur fool.

The idea is to make a MEAN file-host, encrypting the files, without keeping logs, and deleting files every hour.



## TODO
-Integrating MongoDB for file indexing

-Add render engine and make html form

-Generating SSL key and Forcing HTTPS

-Client-side encryption

MORE MORE AND MORE
